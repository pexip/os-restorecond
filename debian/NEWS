policycoreutils (2.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  With this version, the main policycoreutils package has been split in
  several different packages and new executables added:
    - policycoreutils contains the main utilities, like semodule or
      restorecon. This package is also now responsible of automatically
      relabelling the filesystem on boot if needed instead of selinux-basics.
    - policycoreutils-python-utils contains the main utilities that are
      written in python, like semanage or audit2allow.
    - policycoreutils-dev contains the semodules_* executables used to develop
      the policy and the (new) sepolicy executable.
    - restorecond contains restorecond to restore contexts of files that often
      get the wrong context.
    - mcstrans contains mcstransd to map a machine readable sensitivity label
      to a human readable form.
    - newrole contains newrole to switch roles, run_init to run /etc/init.d
      scripts in the proper context.
    - policycoreutils-gui contains (new) executables to graphically configure
      or create policies. Note that these utilities are coming from Red Hat
      and all the features might not work ATM on debian systems.
    - policycoreutils-sandbox contains the scripts to create graphical
      sandboxes. It requires an additional custom policy that is not present
      in Debian.

policycoreutils (1.30.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With this version of policycoreutils, the file /etc/selinux/config
  shall have the variable SELINUXTYPE set to refpolicy-targeted (you may
  also set it to be refpolicy-strict or refpolicy-src). Only 1.30.26-3
  created the file with SELINUXTYPE set to targeted (which is
  appropriate on Red Hat machines and not Debian). We can't
  automatically change /etc/selinux/config (preserve user changes) since
  /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.N might be a legitimate local
  security policy. If it is not, and if any of the files
  /etc/selinux/refpolicy-targeted/policy/policy.N,
  /etc/selinux/refpolicy-strict/policy/policy.N, or
  /etc/selinux/refpolicy-src/policy/policy.N exist, please select one
  for the SELINUXTYPE variable in /etc/selinux/config
